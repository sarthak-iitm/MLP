# MLP
Machine Learning Practice  This companion course to the ML Theory course introduces the student to scikit-learn, a popular Python machine learning module, to provide hands-on problem solving experience for all the methods and models learnt in the Theory course.

What youâ€™ll learn

Understand the life cycle of a machine learning project - typical steps involved and tools that can be used in each step.
Using machine learning algorithms to solve practical problems using libraries like scikit-learn and tensorflow.
Fine tuning the algorithms through regularization, feature selection, and better models.
Develop an understanding of evaluation of machine learning algorithms and decide the next steps based on the analysis.
